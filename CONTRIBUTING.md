* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üö± `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
    * ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use single quotes
* Follow the ESLint configuration
* Use meaningful variable names
* Document complex code sections

Example:
```typescript
// Good
interface UserProps {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function formatUser({ name, email }: UserProps): string {
  return `${name} <${email}>`;
}

// Bad
function format(u: any): string {
  return u.n + ' <' + u.e + '>';
}
```

### Python Styleguide

* Follow PEP 8
* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Use type hints for all new code
* Document functions and classes with docstrings
* Use meaningful variable names
* Keep functions focused and small

Example:
```python
from typing import List, Optional

class DataCollector:
    """Collects and processes system data.
    
    Attributes:
        interval: Collection interval in seconds
        max_items: Maximum number of items to collect
    """
    
    def __init__(self, interval: int = 60, max_items: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
        self.interval = interval
        self.max_items = max_items
        
    def collect_data(self) -> List[dict]:
        """Collects system data.
        
        Returns:
            List of collected data points
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown for documentation
* Reference code with backticks
* Include code examples when relevant
* Keep documentation up to date with code changes
* Use headers to organize content
* Include links to related documentation
